Environmental interaction involve the process of sensing and acting where the AI agent perceives its environment through sensors, interprets the data,
makes decisions, and then takes action to influence the environment with those decisions.

Agents leverage a feedback loop to learn, wherein the human / user can provide the feedback about a particular response of the agent ( whether its correct or not ). 
The feedback loop allows the AI agent to reassess outcomes and refine its future responses to improve performance.

Agents also communicate with each other.
Agent-to-Agent Communication:
1. Messages
2. Databases

Agentic AI has two significant components:

Things that process data within the agents.
Mechnanism that allow two agents to communicate, work and co-ordinate together

How do Agents make decisions:

PLANNING determines whether an AI system adds value or fails. Planning is crucial because it affects the success and value addition of the AI system.
Defining a goal the AI needs to accomplish
Sequence of actions that leads the agent to that goal state
